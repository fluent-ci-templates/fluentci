## Fluent CI CLI

[![deno module](https://shield.deno.dev/x/fluentci)](https://deno.land/x/fluentci)
![deno compatibility](https://shield.deno.dev/deno/^1.34)

Fluent CI is a CI/CD tool that allows you to build, test, and deploy your code. It is a self-hosted solution built on top of [Dagger](https://dagger.io) and [Deno](https://deno.land/), can be run locally or on a server, and is completely free and open-source.

It is also a registry of pre-built pipelines that you can use to build, test, and deploy your code. This means you don't have to write your CI/CD configuration from scratch. You can simply search for and use pipelines that others have already built for frameworks like Django, React, Node, etc.
